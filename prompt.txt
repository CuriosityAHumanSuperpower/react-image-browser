PROJECT : PHASE 1
I need you're help to create an web app. 

0. Prerequisite to your reponse 
Be factual and straightforward 
Do not waste time and AI token on compliments 
Argument choices : why this rather that 
The output should be code/script and explainations/comments in an dedicated markdown file
the language should be mjs rather than js
type variables (mjs), 
find the right balance between, code performance, human readable, maintream application and security
comment functions, and code in general ; not to much except if tricker code 
do not hesitate to question my statement if there is better recommendation in the literrature/experience. Explain why ? 
first analyse what already has been produced in index.html, before genearting new code or updating it

1. general description of the app 
1.1 purpose 
an app that can display images stored locally, 
do basic actions on the image, with keyboard, 
option to scan all the pictures and convert .heic to .jpg and save 
option to face regonition on all the picture 
search bar
database 
1.2 front end
1.2.1 basics 
react 
start from index.html project : an script that do not requires any server. Easy to use but limited 
generate a well structured react project and fractionned into smaller components 
never use pagination but lazy loading on scralling
for picture, on scawnling, maybe unload images not visible anymore, on the screen. If it is a good practice to not overload the page cache. 
Theme : dark, light, pc default, and emerald green (to be adapted and compatible with both dark and light themes)
action button should be round with icon https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/three-dots-vertical/
1.2.2 functionalities
1.2.2.1 
I would like to be able to navigate through the images as if it was a file explorer : 
ctre+A, 
esc,
ctrl+C,
shift+ select images between two selections
ctrl + (un)select images one by one 
right click on PC or hold on phone + the points round button on an image or near the title of the folder to display actions options :
download, copy, add images (+ drag and drop opition) + move to 
on "move to" open a modal, recap the selected images, display the folder (tree) and allow to navigate through and select destination folder
equivalent on mac
rotate image (this should be applyed on the image locally if possible, if not save change/info on db)
1.2.3 design
uses icons rather than emoji : https://icons.getbootstrap.com/ ; npm i bootstrap-icons
do not user button with border. 
On over button background should be a different from general background color but not to much, subtil
for navbar I prefer underline text on over and active page rather than button. By underline, I mean not directly the text (as short cut U) but the bottom of the navbar. It is quite usual on websites.  
1.2.3.1 image modal 
on click on image a modal opens
in addition of what as already been implemented on, add option 3 lines buttons (round list : https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/list/) that can display laterally the following info 
note that the visibility of latteral info should be memorazid in db, if clicked keep visible or invisible by default for all images (general option)
show basic metadata info such as, name, path, creation date, modification date, format, localization (lat, lad) + display on a map 
if click on map, open map page 
display the face recoginized (round image), on click on the open people/person face filter by the name of the person, and display al related images 
1.2.4 pages 
1.2.4.1 homepage
display default folder / last open folder (retrive info from db)
if not last open folder or not accessible/findable display the message 
"No images loaded. Use the to pick images. Works offline and runs from this file."
ask to create a new "collection" and settings on the database
ask param option (see "settings" section)
1.2.4.2 settings
option to display "heic" images with a placeholder 
option to try to display "heic" with a frontend converter
option to automatically convert heic images into .jpg and and the convertion in ./heic-to-jpg folder 
database basic info 
current folder mapped with option to change (browse)
ask to run facerecognition in the background. I do not know if possible or recommandated depending on the amount of CPU/RAM necessary. How to make sure to keep a minimum to run the PC / phone correctly ? 
1.2.4.3 person/people
display faces find in images 
if image of a face recognitioned picture, the image should be round (genearal not only on this page)
add editable name bellow images 
on edit name : give option of already existing name (5 max) that updates depending on what is typing. The search engine should be on the backend 
some actions possible (generic action button (...)) : display all image with this person, rename, delete
several face image can be associated to one name (unique). In that cas only display one image
if a person face is clicked, update url with person ID-slug name 
display a Fluid jumbotron (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/) with the main face picture, the name (editable on click > input), the number of image on with it appears
bellow, the folders> images diplayed
1.2.4.4 map 
for all images that has a localisation, display on a map 
it should be possible to zoom and unzoom
click on a point, divide the screen in two, one side for the map (right) and the images in the displayed area (on the left)
on this page the functionanlity/action on the images should be same as discribe previously 
1.2.5 notification 
handle backend/frontend notification to the user 
https://react-bootstrap.github.io/docs/components/toasts/
do not use to much color (green, orange, red) and pale
top right corner 
button do close 
disapear after ~10 s (what would you recommand ?)
1.3 backend 
1.3.1 general 
express js (mjs)
server should be sectured : rateLimite, helmet, xssClean, hpp  and other relevante one and why ? 
how to handle sensivive info such as db credential. dotenv is not recommanded but it I do not have subscribt to any hostting yet what can I do ? 
1.3.2 database 
1.3.2.1 reflexions
I was wondering what best 
1.3.2.2 models 

1.3.3 middlewares
authenfication
authorization : example (https://github.com/CuriosityAHumanSuperpower/LikEat-backend/blob/main/middlewares/authorization.js), please file free to update and propose better and securer solution
cathcAsync for better log debugging : https://github.com/CuriosityAHumanSuperpower/LikEat-backend/blob/main/middlewares/catchAsync.js please feel free to propose better solution
an error and notification handler for both dev. and prod. circonstances
1.3.4 error and notifications on the frontend
for dev. be as precises as possible 
for prod and client notification, be concise but relevant so that the user can know if s.he did something wrong 
on prod and client notification, be carefull not to give sensitive info, beware of security and app integrity
1.3.4 routes, functionalities/controllers
1.3.2 
10. Open questions 
how to handle two paradigms : (1) local images folder that can be changed by the user and (2) persistant database. For instance what happen if a folder has been selected, this folder is different from the previous one that has been mapped in the db, will the db be reset? new collection created ? what if some pictures are the same in the db and the previous folder ?
how to add virtualization for even larger folders.
integration with pcloud, https://docs.pcloud.com/
adding google authentification 
how to go futher and propose an comercialisation of the app (integrated with pcloud, https://docs.pcloud.com/); how to handle payments, account, security, premiums, legal aspect (usage and GDPR), jigh rank on browser search engine, a simple and catchy name and so on
